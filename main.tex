\section{Introduction}

This short paper is intended to introduce a self-explained tutorial on how to prepare summarised texts to be presented in the form of internal seminars of the Graduate Program in Mechanical Engineering (now on PPGEM) from Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB). In order to suggest a standard formatting for better organization and registration at PPGEM as well as to help incoming students to be acquainted with the {\LaTeX} typesetting, this paper also dismembers into a few goals, such as: i) to work as an introductory text for training in scientific writing among the PPGEM's students and seminar attendees; ii) to strengthen the practical use of English language over the academic environment; iii) to provide guidelines to outline the first version of those research issues that will may be turned into extended abstracts and/or conference papers, and iv) to enhance the PPGEM's academic competitiveness worldwide. 

\section{Text elements and organization}

Basically, your paper should have five major parts: i) Introduction; ii) Methodology; iii) Results; iv) Discussion and v) Conclusion, although the parts iv) e v) may be combined into a unique section. 

You are free to set out the title of your paper provided that you have good reasons to support your choice. It should be totally capitalised. All the sections and subsections should have only the first letter capitalised, except when a proper noun is required. The following examples could be used for titles:
\begin{itemize}
\item  \emph{Robust Methods to Calculate Error Estimates in Div- Formulations}, \\
\item  \emph{Weak Disturbances Formed from Pulsating Wave Sources} or \\
\item  \emph{Continuum Mechanics Bookshelf: from Truesdell to Mase}, 
\end{itemize}
whereas
\begin{itemize}
\item  \emph{Supercritical flows for $ 10 < Fr < 100 $}, \\
\item  \emph{Physicochemistry of copper nanoparticules} or  \\
\item  \emph{Action of the gradient vector} 
\end{itemize}
could be applied to sections or subsections. 

\section{Model and data presentation}

This section explains how to insert equations, figures and tables into your text as well as references to them.

\subsection{Equations \label{subsec:eqs}}

If you need to write equations in your text, whether to represent a model based on differential equations, whether to define expressions of lower complexity, the usual {\LaTeX} environments are applicable to whatever you intend to do, \textit{e.g.} a uniquely labelled equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
  \frac{L}{A}\frac{dW}{dt}=\rho_0\beta g\oint Tdz-f\frac{L}{D}\frac{W^2}{2\rho_0A^2}
\end{equation}
or multi-line labelled equations like 
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:2}
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\D T_1}{\D t}+\frac{W}{A\rho_0}\frac{\D T_1}{\D s}&=&\frac{4q}{D\rho_1c_p} \label{eq:2a} \\
\frac{\D T_2}{\D t}+\frac{W}{A\rho_1}\frac{\D T_2}{\D s}&=&-\frac{4U(\overline{T}-T_s)}{D\rho_2c_p} \label{eq:2b} \\
\frac{\D T_3}{\D t}+\frac{W}{A\rho_2}\frac{\D T_3}{\D s}&=& \displaystyle \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \sin(n \lambda_3)T_3 \label{eq:2c}
 \end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
or
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:3}
  f &=& 8\left[\left(\frac{8}{\Re}\right)^{12} + (A+B^{-1,5})\right]^{1/12} \nonumber \\
  A &=& \left\{-2,457\ln\left[\left(\frac{7}{\Re}\right)^{0,9} + \frac{0,27e}{D}\right]\right\}^{16} \\
  B &=& \left(\frac{37530}{\Re}\right)^{16} \nonumber.
\end{eqnarray}
To reference equations, you may use the commands \verb|\ref{<ref>}| or \verb|\eqref{<ref>}|. ``Equation \eqref{eq:1}'' is the way how you should refer to an equation at the beginning of a statement. ``Equations (\ref{eq:2a}-\ref{eq:2c})'' is the second way, for multi-line cases. If you need refer to another equation in the middle of the text, then you should write ``Eq.~(\ref{eq:2a}-\ref{eq:2c})'' or just ``Eq.~\eqref{eq:3}''.

\subsection{Figures}

Figures are added to your paper as a \emph{nonfloat} element by calling 
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{center}\includegraphics[...]
{figs/<fig_name>} 
(...)
\end{center}
\end{verbatim}
so that
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\columnwidth]{figs/example}
\figcaption{Mass flow with time.}
\label{fig:mass-flow}
\end{center}
is a good example of well placed figure. Reference to figures follow the examples given in Subsection~\ref{subsec:eqs}. That is to say, ``Figure \eqref{fig:mass-flow}'' is the way how you should refer to a figure at the beginning of a statement. If you need refer to a figure in the middle of the text, then you should write ``Fig.~\ref{fig:mass-flow}''. In this case, parentheses are not required.

\subsection{Tables}

Tables like \ref{tbl:1} can also be inserted into your text through the environment \verb|tabular|.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \hline
    & lower bound & upper bound\\
    \hline
    \citet{ambrosini2004} & 285 W & 480 W\\
    present model & 390 W & 707 W\\
    \hline\\
  \end{tabular}
  \tabcaption{Stability thresholds using Churchill's friction correlation, with external fluid temperature of 30ºC.}
  \label{tbl:1}
\end{center}
Reference to tables should not be abbreviated. That is to say, ``Table \ref{tbl:1}'' is the way how you should refer to a figure both at the beginning and in the middle of a statement. Parentheses are not required here as well.
\subsection{Citations}

To cite other authors or references, use the textual and parenthetical commands provided by \verb|natbib| package 
\verb|\cite{<ref1>}| or \verb|\citep{<ref1>}|. Add your references to the file \verb|refs.bib| and compile the document by calling \verb|bibtex|.
The usual \verb|bib| entries are available (see file \verb|refs.bib| in the root directory). This paper's bibliography, for instance, is formed by: a M.Sc. thesis \citep{rabellomsc2007}, a tech report \cite{amarante2001}, a book \citep{batchelor1994}, an inproceedings \cite{lima2009}, and a Ph.D. thesis \citep{loureirophd2008}.

\section{Conclusions}

Here, you will end up your text by drawing conclusions and comments about future work. In order to reduce the contents, we encourage you to summarize the main results by using an itemised list as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item this tutorial has discussed the PPG-EM's paper template;
\item the usability of {\LaTeX} typesetting was presented;
\item a standard template for internal seminars was suggested;
\item to develop other presentation templates is a future goal. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Acknowledgments}

(This section is optional). However, a simple remark like ``The authors thank to Prof. Gustavo Oliveira for sharing insights and ideas in developing the PPGEM's academic templates.'' 
may be included.
